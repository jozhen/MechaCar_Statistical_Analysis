## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
![image](assets/1.png)
### Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
The vehicle length and spoiler angle have the variable that will have a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values because the lower p-values indicate the outcome to be very unlikely.

### Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
The slope is the linear model is not zero because the small p-value strong evidence against the null hypothesis.
### Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
The r-squared value means that about 72% of the predictions will be effective against mpg.
